# Simple PHP Site

> A simple php site with a catalog of items and a form that sends an email.

An example of this page can be found here:
[Simple PHP Site](http://simplephpsite.devingray.me/)

This is a basic PHP site that I have developed as a [Team Treehouse](http://teamtreehouse.com) project.

## Details

This is an example site of a personal Media Library with a catalog of books, movies, and music. We categorize this list based on what page we're on. Our home page will display a random mix of titles, while the books, movies, and music page will display those respective categories respectively.

We also have a basic form that takes name, email, and message arguments so that visitors can suggest titles to add to the library. When we submit this file, it will automatically send an email to the person.
